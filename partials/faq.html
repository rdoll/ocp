    <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" class="faqItem" open="false"
        title="My existing character's attributes/skills are beyond the range of OCP's inputs.">
        <p>
            The attribute and skill inputs for existing characters only support the range of
            unmodified values. When inputing your values, make sure your character is not under
            any spell, ability, or item effects and has no damaged attributes or skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, OCP does not support skills lowered below their initial values by a
            jail sentence nor attributes/skills raised beyond 100 from items (like the
            <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Oghma_Infinium">Oghma Infinium</a>) or
            quest rewards (like from
            <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Origin_of_the_Gray_Prince">Origin of the
            Gray Prince</a>).

    <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" class="faqItem" open="false"
        title="Why doesn't the leveling algorithm assume skills can be lowered by serving a jail sentence or increased by item/quest rewards?">
        <p>
            Not only would this significantly complicate the already complex leveling algorithm,
            but not everyone believes this is an acceptable way to continue leveling after all
            major skills have been maxed.

    <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" class="faqItem" open="false"
        title="How can I do a side-by-side comparison of different character configurations?">
        <p>
            OCP does't support any innate way to do this because it would overly complicate the
            interface. It's best to simply open a new instance of OCP in its own browser window
            for every character configuration you want to compare.
        </p>

    <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" class="faqItem" open="false"
        title="Why did you write OCP?">
        <p>
            When I got Oblivion, I hit the net figure out how I should configure a character for
            my playstyle. While I found lots of info about the complexities and pitfalls of
            Oblivion's leveling process, the only concrete character info was templates that
            others had used. Character templates are great as examples, but if you want to tweak
            one aspect of a template, you are usually at a loss to gauge the full impact of the
            change.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was obvious that a tool was needed, but the only one I found was purely for setup
            -- it didn't do any analysis. For me, the key question is "Can this character
            configuration maximize all attributes with a less-than-perfect playstyle?" While
            playing the game, I don't want to be a slave to the occassional stray Mercantile,
            Acrobatics, or Athletics skill up. After considering the options for a tool with this
            kind of analysis, I settled on a web browser application so it would be easily
            accessible to all Oblivion users.
        </p>

    <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" class="faqItem" open="false"
        title="Who is this Nullis character?">
        <p>
            Nullis is my first Oblivion character and one that I created using OCP. He is a Male
            Khajiit specializing in Stealth Bow attacks -- a kind of medieval sniper. Because of
            OCP, I was able to craft a custom class that allows me to maximize all attributes
            while being able to safely waste a few skill points each level.
        </p>
        <p>
             For fun, I added the complete details of Nullis into OCP. When you
             <a href="javascript:ocp.nullis.safeSetNow();">load Nullis' data</a>, you can see his
             New Character data, a snapshot of his Existing Character data, and the Leveling Order
             I (roughly) followed. Additionally, I added the actual past level data to the
             Leveling Details results. These details are just for fun and they are lost upon any
             changes to the <span class="plannerSection">Character Details</span> or
             <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span>.
         </p>
    </div>

    <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" class="faqItem" open="false"
        title="Why doesn't OCP have more detailed leveling controls like the historical level up data you added with Nullis?">
        <p>
            One of the goals for OCP is that it must be easy to use. The leveling paradigm in
            Oblivion is complex enough, but if users have to set 100 different inputs just to get
            a meaningful result, OCP would be useless to all but the most hardcore players.
            Therefore, beyond the requisite <span class="plannerSection">Character Details</span>,
            OCP uses a simple <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span> to control the
            leveling algoritm.

        title='Why does your email address have to be "decoded"?'>
        <p>
            Some spam bots can parse through web page sources looking for email addresses, so I
            encoded mine. It's not strictly necessary, but it's also an excuse to make a visually
            fun decoding process when you click on
