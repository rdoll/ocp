    OCP Release Notes

    This XML file is processed before being displayed in a pretty HTML format.
    The types for issues and changes are identical. In issues, it means the item
    is missing or broken and in changes it means the item has been added or fixed.

    A function is a small part of a feature (e.g. not validating something) and
    a feature is a large piece of functionality. Function and feature items are
    only listed in the issues list if they are intended to be supported/fixed.

        <issue type="feature" name="Only officially supported browser is FireFox 3.0/3.5">
            While OCP is being designed with browser portability in mind, it only officially
            runs on FireFox 3.0/3.5 because OCP is being developed on it. All other standards
            compliant browsers may or may not work, but no version of IE works yet. In
            future OCP versions, the major releases of Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, and
            Google Chrome will be explicitly supported.
        </issue>

        <issue type="bug" name="The instructions don't properly resize">
            The instructions do not properly resize resulting in wasted space or unncessary
            scrollbars. The complete instructions are always visible, so this is merely an
            annoyance that will be fixed in a future release.
        </issue>

        <issue type="bug" name="Need to report when OCP and/or Dojo scripts don't run">
            Right now there is just a noscript block, but it doesn&apos;t detect when
            the OCP scripts are run but the o.aolcdn.com Dojo ones are not.
        </issue>

        <issue type="function" name="Colors and styles are minimal">
            To simplify development, the colors and styles are designed to be informative,
            but kept to a minimum. If OCP gets hosted as part of a larger site, OCP will
            adopt that site's colors and styling. However, if OCP remains independent,
            it will adopt Oblivion-like colors and styling.
        </issue>

        <issue type="function" name="Release Notes icons are generic">
            The current icons are placeholders. If you know of some cool
            (and free) icons that you think would go well with OCP, please let me know!
        </issue>

        <issue type="feature" name="Ability to share character configurations">
            This will at least include using URL get parameters so a character can be
            shared via a single (albeit long) link.
        </issue>
    </knownissues>

        <version name="0.7.3" type="beta" scope="public" date="23 Aug 2009">
            <change type="function" name="Instructions content completed">
                The full instructions were completed and will be maintained from now on.
            </change>

            <change type="bug"
                name="Changed the Class Dialog's Detailed Class's skill values to match the Initial Stats results section">
                Previously, the skill values shown in the Class Dialog's Detailed Stats tab only
                showed the bonuses above and beyond the minimum skill value. This resulted in the
                table's values not matching the Initial Stats section, which is confusing. Now the
                Detailed Stats's values include the minimum skill value and thus matches the
                output in Initial Stats.

            <change type="feature" name="Created AJAX framework for all OCP modules">
                OCP was partioned into modules so each module could be fully rendered
                without impacting the space of the others. All modules (including the
                Planner) are loaded on demand via AJAX requests.
