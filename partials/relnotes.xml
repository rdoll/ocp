    OCP Release Notes

    This XML file is processed before being displayed in a pretty HTML format.
    The types for issues and changes are identical. In issues, it means the item
    is missing or broken and in changes it means the item has been added or fixed.

    A function is a small part of a feature (e.g. not validating something) and
    a feature is a large piece of functionality. Function and feature items are
    only listed in the issues list if they are intended to be supported/fixed.

        <issue type="feature" name="Only officially supported browser is FireFox 3.0/3.5">
            While OCP is being designed with browser portability in mind, it only officially runs
            on FireFox 3.0/3.5 because OCP is being developed on it. All other standards compliant
            browsers may or may not work, but no version of IE works yet. In future OCP versions,
            the major releases of Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome will be
            explicitly supported.
        </issue>

        <issue type="feature" name="Ability to share character configurations">
            This will at least include using URL get parameters so a character can be shared via a
            single (albeit long) link.
        </issue>

        <issue type="feature"
            name="Support printing of all Character Details and Leveling Results">
            The planner can be printed now, but there's no easy way to print all parts of the
            Character Details and all parts of the Leveling Results in one print out. OCP will get
            a specific print function that formats the desired info for easy all-in-one printing.
            Thanks for the suggestion, Dakota R.
        </issue>

        <issue type="feature" name="Colors and styles are minimal">
            To simplify development, the colors and styles are designed to be informative, but
            kept to a minimum. I intend to update OCP to match the general colors and styles of
            my gracious host <a href="http://www.uesp.net">UESP</a>.
        </issue>

        <issue type="bug" name="Minor issues with some resizing scenarios">
            There are a few unlikely scenarios that can cause unnecessary scrollbars or other
            minor resizing issues. If this happens, you can fix it by changing the size of the
            browser window again. This looks like it is fixed by an improvement in Dojo 1.4, so I
            won't address this bug unless it isn't.
        </issue>

        <issue type="bug" name="Previously selected menu items still look selected">
            This is a bug in Dojo 1.3.2 that is harmless, but a tad sloppy looking. Since it is a
            bug with Dojo, I am not going to bother to work around it unless it still exists in
            Dojo version 1.4.
        </issue>

        <issue type="bug" name="Focus can be incorrect when closing the gender selection dialog">
            Some ways of closing the race's gender selection dialog can result in an incorrect
            input focus. This minor annoyance will be rendered moot when I convert the gender
            selection mechanism to a nested dialog as supported by Dojo version 1.4.
        </issue>

                name="Support selecting a race (and gender) by clicking the images in the race
                    dialog's Overview pane">
                To maintain consistency with the Birthsign and Class panes, clicking on a race's
                image pops up a gender selection dialog.
            </change>
            <change type="feature" name="Added new Advice section">
                While it is beyond OCP's scope to list all possible advice for maximizing the
                potency of a new or existing character, the new Advice section should give players
                a solid starting point for creating powerful characters.

            <change type="feature"
                name="Replaced simple section toggle buttons with a proper menu bar">
                The new menu bar sets the stage for future functions like load/save and printing
                (sorry, they aren't implmented yet).
            </change>
            <change type="feature" name="Added expand/collapse ability to Change Log versions">
                By default, all versions start collapsed so they take up less space.

        <version name="0.7.5" type="beta" scope="private" date="10 Oct 2009">
            <change type="feature" name="Simplified Release Notes categories">
                Release Note items are either a bug or a feature. Remember that items in the Known
                Issues list will get addressed in a future version unless the item's description
                indicates otherwise.
            </change>
            <change type="feature" name="Permanent Release Notes icons added">
                The new icons now clearly indicate bugs and features with tooltip descriptions
                to clarify their meaning. The credits for the new icons were added to the About
                section.

            <change type="feature" name="Changed OCP's home to ocp.uesp.net">
                The fine folks at <a href="http://www.uesp.net">UESP</a> (Unofficial Elder
                Scrolls Pages) have offered to host OCP. As of this release, OCP's official home
                is <a href="http://ocp.uesp.net">http://ocp.uesp.net</a>.

            <change type="feature"
                name="Added ability to select a level's data from the Leveling Details">
                Being able to select the values of a level in the Leveling Details has a few uses,
                but the most important one is to allow multiple Leveling Orders to be used
                throughout the lifespan of a single character.
            </change>

            <change type="feature" name="Added support for browser resizing">
                All modules now dynamically resize when the browser is resized.
            </change>

            <change type="bug"

            <change type="bug"
                name="Improved reporting when OCP and/or Dojo scripts are not executed">
                The OCP validation code also detects when any objects/classes are not defined;
                which implies the browser's JavaScript support is incompatible with the JavaScript
                constructs OCP uses. This is a roundabout way to detect unsupported browsers
                without relying on the very undependable User-Agent string.

                name="Changed the Class Dialog's Detailed Class's skill values to match the
                    Initial Stats results section">
                Previously, the skill values shown in the Class Dialog's Detailed Stats tab only
                showed the bonuses above and beyond the minimum skill value. This resulted in the
                table's values not matching the Initial Stats section, which is confusing. Now the
                Detailed Stats's values include the minimum skill value and thus matches the
                output in Initial Stats.
