<!-- OCP "home page" type overview information -->
<div id="home">
    OCP is a fully functional beta, but as a beta it has some limitations:
    <ol>
        <li>
            FireFox 3.0/3.5 is the only officially supported browser in this beta release.
            All other browsers may or may not work, all versions of IE do not to work.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must allow JavaScript on this server and from o.aolcdn.com.
            For speed, the AOL CDN provides a "local" copy of the Dojo Toolkit.
        </li>
        <li>
            The current colors/styles are minimal, yet (hopefully) informative.
            Upon release, the colors/styles will be made much sexier.
        </li>
    </ol>
