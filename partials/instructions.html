<!-- Usage instructions -->
<!-- TODO: Add complete usage instructions -->
<div id="instructions">
    Complete usage instructions will accompany the full release, but here are some key
    points for this fully functional beta:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The basic usage is to input your new or existing character&apos;s information
            into the <span class="sectionName">Character Details</span> panel,
            set the desired attribute order in the
            <span class="sectionName">Leveling Order</span> panel,
            and then view the generated results in the
            <span class="sectionName">Leveling Results</span> panel. Then, by
            tweaking the character data and/or leveling order, you can use the
            automatically regenerated results to tune your character and formulate
            a rough leveling plan.
        </li>
        <li>
            The two most important parts of the
            <span class="sectionName">Leveling Results</span> are any items with a red
            background (hover over them for an explanation of the issue) and the Spare
            Skill Points values. Spare Skill Points can be increased without needing
            their associated attribute bonus; e.g. gaining the inevitable 1-3 Mercantile
            skill points on levels where Personality is not being raised is safe so long
            as Personality&apos;s Spare Skill Points per Level is 3 or more.
        </li>
        <li>
            When <span class="sectionName">New Character</span> is selected, the values
            of <span class="sectionName">Existing Character</span> are ignored and
            vice-versa.
        </li>
        <li>
            OCP does not take into account skills/attributes beyond the default maximum
            of 100 nor does it account for leveling up by losing major skill points from
            serving a jail sentence.
        </li>
    </ol>

    As an example, you can view the complete new and existing character
    data (including historical leveling details that are lost upon any
    recalculation) for the character I created and leveled using OCP as a guide:
    <a href="javascript:ocp.nullis.safeSetNow();">Nullis</a>.
