                To get the most out of OCP, you need at least a basic understanding of Oblivion's
                leveling process. This process is somewhat complex and best understood after
                you've played the game, but good starting points are the
                <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Leveling">Leveling</a> and
                <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Character_Creation">Character
                    Creation</a> pages at <a href="http://www.uesp.net/">UESP</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the complexity of Oblivion's leveling process, OCP is designed to be very
                simple to use. Full details are in the other instruction tabs, but here are the
                steps for basic usage:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose <span class="plannerSection">New Character</span> or
                    <span class="plannerSection">Existing Character</span> in the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Character Details</span> panel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select the race, birthsign, and class for your new character or enter the
                    level, attributes, and skills for your existing character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change the <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span> to match the
                    order you want to increase your attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every change to the <span class="plannerSection">Character Details</span> and
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span> automatically updates all
                    sections of the <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Results</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Evaluate all sections of the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Results</span>, paying particular
                    attention to anything in red (hover over it for an explanation of the
                    concern).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tweak your <span class="plannerSection">Character Details</span> and
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span> until you are happy with
                    the <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Results</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apply the data to the game! While playing, make sure that you follow the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span> and don't exceed the
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points per Level</span>, and you can
                    achieve OCP's projected maximums.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As your character levels up, you may want to periodically use OCP to recheck
                    that you are still on track to reach your goals.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                To help keep OCP simple, it uses several conventions throughout all parts of the
                planner:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you hover your mouse over most abbreviations, buttons, links, and color
                    highlights, a tooltip with more details may be shown (like
                    <span class="majorSkill"
                        title="Hvy is the abbreviation for the Heavy Armor skill">Hvy</span>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skills are often grouped by which attribute they affect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Major skills are usually shown in <span class="majorSkill">bold</span>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As an example, you can view the complete new and existing character
                data (including historical leveling details that are lost upon any
                recalculation) for the character I created and leveled using OCP as a guide:
                <a href="javascript:ocp.nullis.safeSetNow();">Nullis</a>.

                The biggest part of OCP is selecting your character's details. Whether you have an
                existing character or you are creating a new one, OCP provides a straightforward
                interface that shows the impact of your selections.

                    When you submit any new or existing character detail, the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Results</span> are automatically
                    recalculated and redisplayed. This includes switching between
                    <span class="plannerSection">New Character</span> and
                    <span class="plannerSection">Existing Character</span> sections.

                    OCP does not take into account attributes/skills beyond the standard maximum
                    of 100 nor does it account for skill points lost from serving a jail sentence.
                    If your existing character has an out of range attribute/skill value, set it
                    to the closest valid value and take that into account when you evaluate the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Results</span>.

                The most important time for planning is when creating a new character. There are
                many character configurations that are almost impossible to efficiently level.
                Unfortunately, many of these bad configurations include the default classes and
                the examples used in the Official Game Guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the <span class="plannerSection">New Character</span> section, you can see
                your current selections and a snapshot of their details. Each button opens a
                dialog where you can change your selections.

                    In the overview tab of the race dialog, you'll find details about each race's
                    background, their special abilities and weaknesses, and their general approach
                    to tackling the conflicts in Tamriel. Clicking on a race's image will bring up
                    a sub-dialog for selecting a gender; which is necessary since the starting
                    attributes are different for each gender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the details tab, you'll see all of the starting attributes and skill
                    bonuses for every race and gender. Attributes with a red background are lower
                    than average and attributes with a green background are higher than average.
                    To select a race and gender, press the M or F button in each race's column.

                    The birthsign dialog simply lists all of the birthsigns and their associated
                    benefits. You can select a birthsign by clicking on its image. Any attribute
                    bonuses are shown in the <span class="plannerSection">Initial Stats</span>
                    section and any special abilities are shown in the

                    The class dialog's overview tab describes each predefined class and its
                    details. This is a good way to get a feel for intended play style of each
                    predefined class. You can select a predefined class by clicking on its image.
                </p>

                    The details tab summarizes the attribute bonuses and starting skill values for

                    The custom tab allows you to create your own class instead of using one of the
                    predefined ones. You get to select the specialization, favored attributes, and
                    major skills. To help evaluate the impact of specialization, the skills
                    affected by the current selection are highlighted. Any errors are shown at the
                    bottom of the dialog and must be corrected before a custom class can be

                For existing characters, the new character settings of race (and gender),
                birthsign, and class are no longer necessary for planning and analysis. Instead,
                you simply input the current values of your existing character's attributes and
                skills.
            </p>
            <p class="instructNote">
                <span>Note:</span> Since the game itself controls the values of existing
                characters, OCP does not validate these inputs for sanity. For example, OCP won't
                prevent you from making an existing character with an Endurance of 50 (which
                ensures a minimum Health of 100) and a Health of 70.

                    In truth, a character's level has no impact on OCP's leveling and analysis
                    algorithms. OCP uses only the attributes and skills of a character and does
                    not do any level checking. However, the level slider can be used to select
                    your existing character's level so you can gauge at what level certain things
                    will happen in the future; e.g. at what level will you max out your Magicka.

                    The attributes dialog lets you set the current values of your core and derived
                    attributes. Simply set the correct value for each slider and submit the
                    changes. A summary of the current attributes is shown in the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Existing Character</span> section.

                    All skill values and their major/minor status are entered in the skills
                    dialog. To help ensure the skill values are always valid, checking/unchecking
                    the major status of a skill automatically adjusts the skill's value. Because
                    of this, it is easier to enter the major/minor status of a skill before
                    entering its value. When all settings are valid and you submit the changes, a
                    summary of the current skill values (with major skills shown in
                    <span class="majorSkill">bold</span>) is shown in the

            <p>
                The <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span> is the order that the
                attributes are increased by the simulated leveling algorithm. Each level, the
                first three attributes that are not already maximized are increased. These are
                called the <span class="instructKeyword">Selected Attributes</span>. If
                possible, the skills associated with the
                <span class="instructKeyword">Selected Attributes</span> are also increased to
                yield the maximum possible attribute bonus.
            </p>
            <p>
                To change the order of attributes, simply drag and drop them. The first
                attribute chosen is at the top of the list. You can use Shift-click and

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The attribute leveling order is the first factor taken into account by the
                    leveling process and overrides all others. The
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Selected Attributes</span> will be raised
                    regardless of any skill bonuses. For example, if Strength, Endurance, and
                    Intelligence are the
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Selected Attributes</span>, they will all be
                    increased even if Strength can only be raised by 1 point while Willpower can
                    be raised by 5 points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If possible, the leveling algorithm will accrue the 10 major skill points
                    necessary to level from the skills associated with the
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Selected Attributes</span>. If the 10 points
                    cannot be found from those skills, the leveling algorithm uses the least
                    important major skills first.

                The information in <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Results</span> is the
                reason OCP exists. The results are automatically recalculated and redisplayed

                <span class="plannerSection">Character Details</span> or the
                <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Order</span>. The results are broken down

                While the leveling algorithm and analysis attempts to be as smart as possible, it
                is still not as smart as you can be. Plus, while playing, it is possible that
                situations will arise that make a different leveling path more efficient. When
                this occurs, you should use OCP to re-evaluate your path and make the best
                decision for your play goals.

                    <span class="plannerSection">Existing Character</span> section. However, for
                    new characters, this gives a breakdown of how your race, birthsign, and class
                    contributed to your starting attribute and skill values. Per usual, major
                    skills are highlighted in <span class="majorSkill">bold</span>.

            <div class="moduleSubsection">
                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Leveling Details</div>
                <p>
                    The <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Details</span> shows the level by
                    level breakdown of the simulated leveling process. Each level, the
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Selected Attributes</span> are increased as well
                    as any skills that yield an attribute bonus or are required for the major
                    points necessary to level. The values for all majors skills are shown in
                    <span class="majorSkill">bold</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All changed values are shown with a yellow background. All values that could
                    not be raised or maximized when they should have been are shown with a red
                    background. These red background numbers are especially important because they
                    indicate areas where the leveling process was less than optimal. Hovering your
                    mouse over any red background number will show a tooltip explaining the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Selecting a level loads that level's details into the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Existing Character</span> section. This allows
                    you to evaluate the impact of multiple attribute orders; e.g. if you want to
                    raise your Intelligence to 75ish for the extra Magicka, but then switch to
                    Willpower for the Magicka regeneration. Just load the level data prior to the
                    order switch, switch the order, and evaluate the aggregate results.

                <p>
                    After the leveling process has been simulated, OCP analyzes the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Details</span> and displays the
                    important points in the <span class="plannerSection">Analysis</span> section.
                    Since the analysis is based on the
                    <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Details</span>, any inefficiencies there
                    will be reflected in the <span class="plannerSection">Analysis</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like with the <span class="plannerSection">Leveling Details</span>, anything
                    with a red background indicates a sub-optimal value. Make sure you hover over
                    each one to get an explanation of why the value is considered sub-optimal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless you are a hardcore, power-leveling player, you will inevitably get a
                    few uninteded skill ups in some of the more useful skills; e.g. it's hard to
                    avoid gaining a few points in Mercantile or Athletics every level. When this
                    occurs, the key question is whether or not these ancillary skill ups will
                    detract from your maximum potency. This is where
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points per Level</span> come into
                    play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an attribute has been maximized, the remaining points in its associated
                    skills are considered <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points</span>.
                    In other words, if you &quot;wasted&quot; all of your
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points</span>, you could still reach
                    your character's maximum potency. Thus the
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points per Level</span> is the
                    number of skill points you can waste every level until an attribute is
                    maximized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points per Level</span>,
                    you can gauge how careful (or careless!) you have to be with the skill ups for
                    each attribute. When planning your character, be very careful about attributes
                    whose <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points per Level</span> is
                    less than 2 or 3. If you maintain a proper number of
                    <span class="instructKeyword">Spare Skill Points per Level</span>, you can
                    ensure that your gameplay experience won't be hindered by trying to avoid
                    premature skill ups.
