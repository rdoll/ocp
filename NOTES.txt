Fix level bug (grep BUG in ocp-level.js)
Move cclass _customData into _data ???
Change cclass to clazz ?
Change all plural dirs to singular ?
Change int to itl?

Migrate the hacks in the SetNullis* functions into their
appropriate files; e.g. add an ocp.order.setOrder(newOrder) ??

Like I did in ocp.level._nextLevel, is it worth creating an
object for quicker isMajor lookups instead of doing an indexOf?
If this was done to ocp.cclass.isMajor and ocp.existing.isMajor,
I'd never need to worry about calling ocp.input.isMajor.

Is some memory leaking after each page reload?

Allow http://.../index.html?debug to enable debugging?

+ Using "for" (and dereferencing an index) instead of "for each"
+ Using "dojo.indexOf" instead of "Array.indexOf"

This currently fails in IE for several reasons, but major ones are:
+ IE doesn't support XHTML. Per http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/,
  many <.../> tags need to be converted to <...></...>.
+ IE doesn't support getters which are used all over the place
Even with these fixed, the styles are still not properly rendered in IE.

*** Need license details and copyright info atop every file
*** Globally replace title="" attributes with Tooltips?
*** Use some kind of decoration to indicate a tooltip is available (dashed underline?)?
