Migrate the hacks in the SetNullis* functions into their
appropriate files; e.g. add an ocp.order.setOrder(newOrder) ??

Like I did in ocp.level._nextLevel, is it worth creating an
object for quicker isMajor lookups instead of doing an indexOf?
If this was done to ocp.clazz.isMajor and ocp.existing.isMajor,
I'd never need to worry about calling ocp.input.isMajor.

Is some memory leaking after each page reload?

Allow http://.../index.html?debug to enable debugging?
Or unnecessary since FireBug works regardless of djConfig.debug value?
Needed for other browsers perhaps?

Should include Jump Height (derived from Acrobatics) and
Water Breathing (derived from Endurance? -- check USEP Water Breathing
discussion page) in derived attributes?
Magicka regeneration rate (derived from Magicka and Willpower)?

Should have an Advice top-level page?

Can make planner resize-able with min-width/height?

Select a http://creativecommons.org/ license, add it to file headers,
and add an icon to the footer for it.

In Change Log, tag each release as public release or dev release and
use a top level toggle to control showing/hiding them?

Ok that faq's TitlePane title="" attrs go really long?

FAQ's non-expanded titles are a little gray. Override to black?

Keep home.roadrunner.com/~foaminator as home page in about?

Replace all innerHTML references with "content" for compatibility?

Standardize all race and birthsign specials with their real name and their exact effects.
-----

Neal Notes:

Race overview images cannot be clicked upon -- different from birth and class.
Webcast video tutorial?
Up front message if browser is known not to be supported?

-----
Icons:

Need to add icon credits.
Need to convent icons from links to real images.

Possible Fugue Icons:
application +, - for feature
bandaid plain, +, - for bug fixed
bomb for bug
burn for bug
compile plain, warning, error for bug minor, major, critical?
document plain, +, - for feature
exclamation for bug minor, major, critical
fire for bug minor, major, critical
gear for improvement?
information for minor bug or bug fixed?
lifebuoy for bug fixed
minus/plus for bug/fixed
script for feature or enhancement
tick for bug fixed
ticket for bugs
wrench for improvement

Could embed tick on other items to create "solved" versions of bugs, limitations, etc

For JavaScript browser compatibility per
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(ECMAScript)
+ Using "for" (and dereferencing an index) instead of "for each"
+ Using "dojo.indexOf" instead of "Array.indexOf"

This currently fails in IE for several reasons, but major ones are:
+ IE doesn't support XHTML. Per http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/,
  many <.../> tags need to be converted to <...></...>.
+ IE doesn't support getters which are used all over the place
Even with these fixed, the styles are still not properly rendered in IE.

TODO: Globally replace title="" attributes with Tooltips?
TODO: Use some kind of decoration to indicate a tooltip is available (dashed underline?)?
TODO: Can use [title] CSS selector to find them all...

TODO: Nice set of images (and nice credit page) at http://www.elderstats.com/about/?p=credits

&apos; unsupported in IE?!? Standardize on something for all HTML apostrophes.

Is it ok to split HTML attribute values across lines? (e.g. index.html's meta content='s)
