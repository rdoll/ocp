*** Contact me links with Tooltip's letter decoder's animation is way too fast ***

Tooltips:
- They don't work on buttons or images per-release notes known issue
- The Dojo dialog's cancel button uses a browser default title= tooltip
- Creating tooltips for the entire results (including non-changing table headers) is probably
    pretty expensive

In race gender selection sub-dialog, show stat differences? Or keep all stats in details?

With Arial, Helvetica, and Times (instead of Verdana), there are vertical scrollbars in the
  Leveling Order and Leveling Results panels.

Migrate the hacks in the SetNullis* functions into their
appropriate files; e.g. add an ocp.order.setOrder(newOrder) ??

Is some memory leaking after each page reload?
This may be a leak in FireBug -- not OCP or Dojo!

Allow http://.../index.html?debug to enable debugging?
Or unnecessary since FireBug works regardless of djConfig.debug value?
Needed for other browsers perhaps?

Should include Jump Height (derived from Acrobatics) and
Water Breathing (derived from Endurance? -- check USEP Water Breathing
discussion page) in derived attributes?
Magicka regeneration rate (derived from Magicka and Willpower)?

Select a http://creativecommons.org/ license, add it to file headers,
and add an icon to the footer for it.

Standardize all race and birthsign specials with their real name and their exact effects.

#faq and #changeLog .dijitTitlePane* styles are almost identical. If icons change,
see if I can combine these into one set of generic styles.

Replace M/F in Race Details with Male and Female icons. &#x2642; and &#x2640; chars look
crappy -- need icons.

From http://www.dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-2-dijit/user-assistance-and-feedback/tooltip

  Tooltips are displayed when the associated item receives focus or a mouseover event. Be careful
  when assigning tooltips to arbitrary elements such as spans of text which may not receive keyboard
  focus because users of assistive technology or keyboard only users will not benefit from the
  tooltip. If the tooltip information is important, make certain that the item which triggers
  display of the tooltip can receive focus via the keyboard. This can be accomplished by adding a
  tabindex="0" attribute onto the trigger element to put it into the tab order of the page.

  For all red things in results, ensure tooltips can be tabbed into.

In ocp.results._updateLeveling, I cache the ocp.input.isMajor results saving 1,000 calls.
In ocp.level._nextLevel, there are 20ish ocp.input.isMajor calls (the same number there
    would be if I cached the results like I did in ocp.results._updateLeveling), but
    because ocp.level._nextLevel is called 50 times, it results in 1,000 calls again.
    If this matters, I either need to move the cache up to ocp.level._updateLeveling or
    I need to use ocp.input.majors in _nextLevel instead of ocp.input.isMajor.

Neal Notes:

Race overview images cannot be clicked upon -- different from birth and class.
Webcast video tutorial?
Up front message if browser is known not to be supported?

Icons:

Need to convent icons from links to real images.

Possible Fugue Icons:
application +, - for feature
bandaid plain, +, - for bug fixed
bomb for bug
burn for bug
compile plain, warning, error for bug minor, major, critical?
document plain, +, - for feature
exclamation for bug minor, major, critical
fire for bug minor, major, critical
gear for improvement?
information for minor bug or bug fixed?
lifebuoy for bug fixed
minus/plus for bug/fixed
script for feature or enhancement
tick for bug fixed
ticket for bugs
wrench for improvement

Could embed tick on other items to create "solved" versions of bugs, limitations, etc

Current icons:
OCP name             Fugue name
bug-change.png       fugue-icons-2.2.2/icons/overlay/bandaid--plus.png
bug-issue.png        fugue-icons-2.2.2/icons/overlay/bandaid--exclamation.png
feature-change.png   fugue-icons-2.2.2/icons/overlay/application--plus.png
feature-issue.png    fugue-icons-2.2.2/icons/overlay/application--exclamation.png
function-change.png  fugue-icons-2.2.2/icons/overlay/gear--plus.png

For JavaScript browser compatibility per
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(ECMAScript)
+ Using "for" (and dereferencing an index) instead of "for each"
+ Using "dojo.indexOf" instead of "Array.indexOf"

This currently fails in IE for several reasons, but major ones are:
+ IE doesn't support XHTML. Per http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/,
  many <.../> tags need to be converted to <...></...>.
+ IE doesn't support getters which are used all over the place
Even with these fixed, the styles are still not properly rendered in IE.

TODO: Nice set of images (and nice credit page) at http://www.elderstats.com/about/?p=credits

&apos; unsupported in IE?!? Standardize on something for all HTML apostrophes.

Is it ok to split HTML attribute values across lines? (e.g. index.html's meta content='s)
The W3C Markup validator says it is XHTML 1.0 Strict valid, but will it work in all browsers?

Starting with Dojo 1.4, all layout containers get a doLayout=false.
This allows the children of the layout container widget to size themselves.
They even seem to resize themselves after the parent changes sizes (e.g. from a
browser resize). This seems backwards to me, but that's what works as of Dojo 1.4 and
means the resize hooks are no longer necessary.

    Without the ocp._initializeResizeHooks, the instructions nested Tab container was not
    resizing properly. Here are the old comments describing the issue:

    <!-- TODO: ocpStackContainer is sized via the dimensions of instructionsOverview and
         TODO: does not resize when a different tab is selected resulting in scrollbars. -->
    <!-- TODO: Switching from Home/Planner/expanded FAQ/Release Notes to Instructions puts a
         TODO: horizontal scrollbar in Instructions. Oddly, collapsed FAQ and About don't.
         TODO: I think it's related to having the scrollbar on the RHS of the browser window.
         TODO: Can fix it by a dijit.byId('instructionsContentPane').resize() after
         TODO: Instructions has been selected and has the horizontal scrollbar.
         TODO: Is the root cause the doLayout=false? -->
    <!-- TODO: Also the instructions are not resized when the browser is resized. -->

    With ocp._initializeResizeHooks the browser resize problems are gone, but the Planner does
    resize a little more than it should; e.g. when you shrink the browser's width, the planner's
    input area gets taller instead of remaining the same and using a horizontal scrollbar.

    However, the switching from Release Notes (with a vertical scrollbar) to Instructions (that
    should be without a vertical scrollbar) still results in the Instructions having a horizontal
    scrollbar. Two dijit.byId('instructionsContentPane').resize()'s fixes it, but connecting to
    instructionsContentPane's onShow or ocpStackController's onSelectChild and doing the two
    resizes never worked (the content had no size and only the min-height for loader messages
    was honored).

=========
Publishing Checklist:

- Version number is correct and ocp._initializeVersions's beta literal is correct
- relnotes.xml has the correct info for this version including the release date
- index.html and ocp.css uses o.aolcdn.com instead of local dojotoolkit
    + includes djConfig baseUrl and modulePaths changes
    + remove dojotoolkit link and test locally first
- Comment out ocp.loader.hookManagedContainer's preventing caching
- Upload all except ocpsetup.bash file and test directory
