Move cclass _customData into _data ???
Change cclass to clazz ?
Change int to itl?

Migrate the hacks in the SetNullis* functions into their
appropriate files; e.g. add an ocp.order.setOrder(newOrder) ??

Like I did in ocp.level._nextLevel, is it worth creating an
object for quicker isMajor lookups instead of doing an indexOf?
If this was done to ocp.cclass.isMajor and ocp.existing.isMajor,
I'd never need to worry about calling ocp.input.isMajor.

Is some memory leaking after each page reload?

Allow http://.../index.html?debug to enable debugging?
Or unnecessary since FireBug works regardless of djConfig.debug value?
Needed for other browsers perhaps?

Should include Jump Height (derived from Acrobatics) and
Water Breathing (derived from Endurance? -- check USEP Water Breathing
discussion page) in derived attributes?

Should have an Advice top-level page?

Can make planner resize-able with min-width/height?

Release Notes mentioned "if you know of better icons, please let me know".
Either need HTML in issue/change details and/or proper contact info.

Select a http://creativecommons.org/ license, add it to file headers,
and add an icon to the footer for it.

Neal Notes:

Race overview images cannot be clicked upon -- different from birth and class.
Custom class dialog too short.
Webcast video tutorial?
Up front message if browser is known not to be supported?

Icons:

Need to add icon credits.
Need to convent icons from links to real images.

Possible Fugue Icons:
application +, - for feature
bandaid plain, +, - for bug fixed
bomb for bug
burn for bug
compile plain, warning, error for bug minor, major, critical?
document plain, +, - for feature
exclamation for bug minor, major, critical
fire for bug minor, major, critical
gear for improvement?
information for minor bug or bug fixed?
lifebuoy for bug fixed
minus/plus for bug/fixed
script for feature or enhancement
tick for bug fixed
ticket for bugs
wrench for improvement

Could embed tick on other items to create "solved" versions of bugs, limitations, etc

For JavaScript browser compatibility per
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(ECMAScript)
+ Using "for" (and dereferencing an index) instead of "for each"
+ Using "dojo.indexOf" instead of "Array.indexOf"

This currently fails in IE for several reasons, but major ones are:
+ IE doesn't support XHTML. Per http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/,
  many <.../> tags need to be converted to <...></...>.
+ IE doesn't support getters which are used all over the place
Even with these fixed, the styles are still not properly rendered in IE.

TODO: Globally replace title="" attributes with Tooltips?
TODO: Use some kind of decoration to indicate a tooltip is available (dashed underline?)?

TODO: Nice set of images (and nice credit page) at http://www.elderstats.com/about/?p=credits

&apos; unsupported in IE?!?
