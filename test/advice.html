                Some of this is factual, but a lot of it is my own personal opinion.
                Key point: no wrong way to play so long as you enjoy it!
                Make sure you understand the leveling algorithm (uesp link)
                or this won't make sense.

            <p>

                The most important and impactful decision is the first one: how important is your
                character's potency?  Naturally everyone wants to maximize their character's
                potency, but because of the &quot;Leveling Problem&quot;, maximizing potency
                requires careful planning and work. Like all things in Oblivion, this boils down
                to a choice: the more you want to maximize your character's potency, the harder
                you will have to work at it.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="moduleSection">
            <div class="moduleTitle">Leveling Approaches</div>
            <p>

                The first thing that will determine your character's final potency is how you want
                to deal with leveling. Because the monsters, quests, and gear in Oblivion are
                fixed for each level, how you choose to handle your character's leveling will have
                a substantial impact on his/her final potency.

            </p>

            <div class="moduleSubsection">
                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Ignoring the &quot;Leveling Problem&quot;</div>
                <p>

                    One way you can play Oblivion is by ignoring the &quot;Leveling Problem&quot;
                    entirely. Just choose what feels right and do whatever you want in-game. If
                    your character's potency drops compared to the monsters' potency, you don't
                    care. And if you get stuck, you can always reduce the game's difficulty.

                </p>
                <p>

                    This approach gives the highest amount of freedom, but is most likely to yield
                    a low potency character.

                </p>

            <div class="moduleSubsection">
                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Under Leveling</div>
                <p>

                    As discussed in

                    <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Under_Leveling">UESP's Under
                        Leveling page</a>,

                    the concept of Under Leveling is to rarely/never sleep which keeps you near
                    level 1. Because the monsters' potency remains fixed while yours increases via
                    skill ups, your character ends up being comparatively much more potent then
                    all monsters.

                </p>
                <p>

                    The big down side to this is that you cannot access anything that has a level
                    requirement. This includes many quests and their associated powerful rewards.
                    Also, this tends to make obtaining cash harder, which makes the high fixed
                    prices of bigger items (e.g. houses and housing upgrades) somewhat painful.

                </p>
                <p>

                    This approach gives a high amount of freedom and will result in a character
                    with a comparatively high potency, but you will miss out on some aspects of
                    the overall game.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="moduleSubsection">
                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Power Leveling</div>
                <p>

                    Power leveling is what the most hard-core players do. Not only is every
                    attribute and skill planned out before the character has been created, but
                    every skill up is done in a deliberate and controlled fashion. Often power
                    levelers do nothing for many levels except raise their skills (e.g. jumping in
                    place for Acrobatics, summoning the same Zombie over and over for Conjuration,
                    etc). Only after the power leveling is complete do they &quot;play&quot; the
                    game itself.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Note that power levelers can engage in some small parts of the game, but they
                    do so only to further their leveling. A common example would be gaining access
                    to Spellmaking and Enchancement altars (say, by doing the Mage's Guild's
                    Recommendation quests). What makes someone a power leveler is that they level
                    up first and then play the rest of the game second.

                </p>
                <p>

                    This approach gives the least amount of freedom, but will yield the highest
                    possible character potency.

                </p>

            <div class="moduleSubsection">
                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Hybrid Leveling</div>
                <p>

                    The majority of players are in between ignoring the &quot;Leveling
                    Problem&quot; and Power Leveling. If you completely ignore the
                    &quot;Leveling Problem&quot;, you'll probably end up reducing the game's
                    difficulty at some point and some people feel that's akin to cheating. OTOH,
                    even if you want to power level, it's very difficult to do that the first
                    time you play the game.

                </p>
                <p>

                    The middle ground, as I'm defining it, is a hybrid where you want to do your
                    best to plan for and overcome the &quot;Leveling Problem&quot;, but you also
                    want to minimize the time spent power leveling. A hybrid player wants to spend
                    their time playing the game without having their choices hurt them in the long
                    run. Hybrid players start each level by doing whatever they want and then do a
                    few power leveling skill ups to actually complete the level with maximum
                    potency.

                </p>
                <p>

                    This approach gives a meidum amount of freedom, but can yield a highly potent
                    character. FWIW, I used a Hybrid Leveling approach with Nullis and have been
                    very pleased with how it has gone.

            <div class="moduleTitle">Dealing with Luck</div>
            <p>

                Before deciding how to deal with your character's Luck, you need to understand
                how Luck impacts your character's potency.

                <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Luck">UESP's Luck page</a> has all of
                the details, but for planning purposes, Luck has two key aspects:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    Luck raises all skills <span class="majorEmphasis">up to</span> 100 points. So
                    at the start of the game when all of your skills are below 100, Luck has more
                    effect. At the end of the game when all of the skills you use are at or near
                    100, Luck does almost nothing for you. So if you are going to go after Luck,
                    it is better to do it sooner rather than later.

                </li>
                <li>

                    Luck can only be raised by one point each level. If you decide you want to
                    increase your Luck, then getting +10 Luck from The Thief birthsign and/or +5
                    Luck from a Favored Attribute of a Custom Class is

                    <span class="majorEmphasis">very</span> helpful. Since other attributes can be
                    raised 5 points per level, starting with these bonuses reduces the number of
                    levels required to maximize Luck; e.g. choosing The Warrior for its +10
                    Strength means you need 10 level ups of Luck to equal The Thief's bonus, but
                    choosing The Thief allows you to obtain The Warrior's +10 Strength in two
                    levels.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="moduleSubsection">
                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Completely Ignoring Luck</div>
                <p>

                    You don't choose The Thief birthsign nor do you make Luck a Favored Attribute
                    of a Custom Class. Luck starts at 50 and is not leveled up until all other
                    attributes have been maximized.

                </p>
                <p>

                    This is the simplest way to handle Luck, but your character never reaps any
                    benefits from Luck, arguably making your character less potent.

                </p>

                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Luck Last Leveling</div>
                <p>

                    In Luck Last leveling (aka 5/5/5 leveling -- meaning 3 attributes are raised 5
                    points each), you care about Luck some, but you care more about the other
                    attributes.

                </p>

                <div class="moduleSubtitle">Luck First Leveling</div>
                <p>

                    Luck First leveling (aka 5/5/1 leveling - meaning 2 attributes are raised 5
                    points and Luck is raised 1) is used when you value Luck above all other
                    attributes. Every level you increase Luck by 1 until it is maximized. You
                    probably want to select The Thief birthsign and make Luck a Favored Attribute
                    of a Custom Class to reduce the number of Luck level ups necessary to its
                    minimum of 35 levels.

                </p>
                <p>

                    You have to sacrifice your birthsign and one of the two Favored Attributes of
                    your class to Luck,
                    Because Luck has no skills that require increasing for a bonus, levels will
                    come a bit quicker than 5/5/5 leveling.

                    every level up only needs 10 major skill points and 10 minor skills
                    points,

                </p>
