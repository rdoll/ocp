    OCP Release Notes

    This XML file is processed before being displayed in a pretty HTML format.
    The types for issues and changes are identical. In issues, it means the item
    is missing or broken and in changes it means the item has been added or fixed.

    A function is small part of a feature (e.g. not validating something) and
    a feature is a large piece of functionality. Function and feature items are
    only listed in the issues list if they are intended to be supported.
