## No Longer Supported

Unfortunately, I can no longer support OCP. I am very happy with how OCP turned out and the warm reception the Oblivion community gave me and it.

Years later, there are still people playing Oblivion, so I took the time to put the full source into this GitHub repository. However, I did not actually test anything. For example, I know there are Linux soft links that were used which cannot be reflected in a git repository, but I believe these are trivial enough that anyone can figure them out. With this source tree in hand, perhaps others can modify OCP to do new and better things.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to give a special thanks to UESP (https://uesp.net). The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages has been curating the best information, tools and community for all The Elder Scrolls games for decades. When I asked them to host OCP, they provided everything and never asked me for anything. Sincerely, thank you UESP for all you've done for me and OCP!
